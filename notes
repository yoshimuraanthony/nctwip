title: Quantum model for gamma radiation damamge

# attention getter: A way to lead the audience to the need efficiently
Have the material properties changed?
# Context: what do the readers need to know to understand the need?
Ballistic electrons produce damage
# need: A difference between actual and desired situations
We aim to model continuous material properties under years of radiation
but...
Defects are produced instantaneously at the subatomic scale
# task: What I decided/was asked to do to address the need
Develop a predictive quantum mechanical picture of how electrons interact with
subatomic material particles
# main message: The one sentence I want my audience to remember
Electronic excitations are important to consider
# preview: A map of the body (ideally three points, max. five)

# point 1:
# transition:
# point 2: excitation probabilities
# transition: a more concrete example
# point 3: electronic excitations dramatically accelerate sputtering
