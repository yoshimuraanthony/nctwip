title: A Quantum model for gamma radiation damage

# attention getter: A way to lead the audience to the need efficiently
The weapon's been in the stockpile for decades. 
Have the material properties changed?
# Context: what do the readers need to know to understand the need?
Under Gamma radiation,
ballistic electrons produce damage and change material properties
# need: A difference between actual and desired situations
We aim to model continuous material properties under years of radiation
but...
Defects are produced instantaneously at the subatomic scale
# task: What I decided/was asked to do to address the need
Develop a predictive quantum mechanical picture of how ballistic electrons
interact with subatomic material particles (electrons and nuclei)
# main message: The one sentence I want my audience to remember
These electron interactions with material nuclei and electrons must be
considered to properly describe the effects of radiation
As the name suggests, quantum electrodynamics provides an intuitive, feasible,
and predictive means of doing so.

# background
# plots: Klein-Nishina formula (d\sigma/dE)
* A gamma photon can boost a ballistic electron to a large range of energies
  * plots: Klein-Nishina formula (d\sigma/dE)
* damage involves the displacement of nuclei, not electrons (metastable states
  are quite rare)
* Rutherford Scattering
* get the differential cross section w.r.t. energy transfer
* integrate over energy transfers greater than the binding energy
* plots: displacement cross section PE, PDMS
* 2D materials provide an excellent platform to test this theory
* plots: displacement cross section MoS2, hBN
  * agreement with experiment is not so good
* This model is missing something: electronic excitation can affect nuclear
  dynamics.
  1. non-radiative decay
  2. bond softening
    * while the electrons are excited, they reduce the binding energy
  * excited electron will eventually relax

# preview: A map of the body (ideally three points, max. five)
1. non-radiative decay
2. bond softening

# transition:
# point 1: non-radiative decay excites nuclear vibrations
# plots: scatter: PE, PDMS, MoS2, hBN
* non radiative relaxation couples to the phonons
* The amount of energy contributed and the modes excited depend on the specific
  excitation
  * images: band diagram and bond excitations
* Moller Scattering
  * images: Feynman diagram and amplitudes
* get the probability density w.r.t. crystal momentum
* PE as an example:
  * band gap of ~6 eV
  * probabilities of most likely transitions decrease with increasing t-energy
  * this means we can ignore ionization and core excitations
  * direct transitions are more likely than indirect transitions
* The probabilities of direct transitions are insensitive to ballistic electron
  energy
* PDMS transitions are more likely
* hBN and MoS2

# transition: 
# point 2: electronic excitations dramatically accelerate sputtering
* if radiative lifetime is longer than a few hundred femto seconds, then
  electronic excitations can reduce the binding energy.
* degree of bond softening depends on number of excitations
* probability curves
* Excitation-assisted displacement cross section plots: MoS2, hBN
  * show contribution of each excitation next to dxs plot
* compare with experiment
* Compare ground and excited DXS

# review: A recap of the body, leading into the conclusion
We've shown that the effects of radiation damage can be described properly only
if both nuclear and electronic scattering is considered
# conclusion: What the above means to the audience in the end
We have a way to predict the rates of atomic displacement under
# close: A way to end the presentation clearly and elegantly
Many process of interest are mediated by subatomic particle interactions, many
of which involve electrons
There is a need to connect very disparate length and time scales
In my humble opinion, there is a great opportunity to be made

* the coupling of both

# prologue
Intro to Feynman diagrams and scattering
* A scattering event is an event that changes the trajectories of a set of
  particles
* Example: Compton scattering is the scattering of (non-specified interaction
  circle
* incoming states are time evolved by T and overlapped with outgoing states
* such an event can be represented pictorially by a Feynman diagram
* building blocks: segments and vertices represent amplitudes for particle
  propagation and interaction
  * see p.1{18,45} in Peskin, or p.3{45,50} lancaster
* each segment/vertex corresponds to a matrix/vector object
* certain combinations can connect the incoming and outgoing states
* The amplitude of a scattering event is the product of the amplitudes of the
  processes that make up the event's diagram.
* the most likely events are those containing the fewest vertices
* turn diagram into amplitude
* differentiate with respect to a particular variable

* The probabilities of direct transitions are insensitive to e-energy
* PDMS transitions are more likely
