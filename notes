title: A Quantum model for gamma radiation damage

# attention getter: A way to lead the audience to the need efficiently
The weapon's been in the stockpile for decades. 
Have the material properties changed?
# Context: what do the readers need to know to understand the need?
Under Gamma radiation,
ballistic electrons produce damage and change material properties
# need: A difference between actual and desired situations
We aim to model continuous material properties under years of radiation
but...
Defects are produced instantaneously at the subatomic scale
# task: What I decided/was asked to do to address the need
Develop a predictive quantum mechanical picture of how electrons interact with
subatomic material particles (electrons and nuclei)
# main message: The one sentence I want my audience to remember
We must consider both nuclear and electron scattering to properly describe the
effects of radiation
# preview: A map of the body (ideally three points, max. five)

# prologue
Intro to Feynman diagrams and scattering
* A scattering event is an event that changes the trajectories of a set of
  particles
* such an event can be represented pictorially by a Feynman diagram
* the most likely event is that containing
* segments and vertices represent amplitudes for particle propagation and
  interaction
* The amplitude of a scattering event is the product of the amplitudes of the
  processes that make up the event's diagram.

Compton scattering

# point 1: nuclear scattering (phonon and sputtering)
Mott Scattering
plots: displacement cross section PE, PDMS, MoS2, hBN

# transition:
# point 2: electron scattering (excitation and ionization)
Moller Scattering
plots: scatter: PE, PDMS, MoS2, hBN

# transition: a more concrete example
# point 3: electronic excitations dramatically accelerate sputtering
Excitation-assisted displacement cross section plots: MoS2, hBN
Compare ground and excited DXS

# review: A recap of the body, leading into the conclusion
# conlusion: What the above means to the audience in the end
# close: A way to end the presentation clearly and elegantly
