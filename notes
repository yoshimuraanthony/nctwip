title: A Quantum model for gamma radiation damage

# attention getter: A way to lead the audience to the need efficiently
The weapon's been in the stockpile for decades. 
Have the material properties changed?
# Context: what do the readers need to know to understand the need?
Under Gamma radiation,
ballistic electrons produce damage and change material properties
# need: A difference between actual and desired situations
We aim to model continuous material properties under years of radiation
but...
Defects are produced instantaneously at the subatomic scale
# task: What I decided/was asked to do to address the need
Develop a predictive quantum mechanical picture of how electrons interact with
subatomic material particles (electrons and nuclei)
# main message: The one sentence I want my audience to remember
We must consider both nuclear and electron scattering to properly describe the
effects of radiation
# preview: A map of the body (ideally three points, max. five)
We will consider
* electron-nuclear
* electron-electron
* the coupling of both

# prologue
Intro to Feynman diagrams and scattering
* A scattering event is an event that changes the trajectories of a set of
  particles
* Example: Compton scattering is the scattering of (non-specified interaction circle)
* incoming states are time evolved by T and overlapped with outgoing states
* such an event can be represented pictorially by a Feynman diagram
* building blocks: segments and vertices represent amplitudes for particle
  propagation and interaction
  * see p.145 in Peskin, or p.350 lancaster
* each segment/vertex corresponds to a matrix/vector object
* The amplitude of a scattering event is the product of the amplitudes of the
  processes that make up the event's diagram.
* the most likely events are those containing the fewest vertices
* turn diagram into amplitude
* differentiate with respect to a particular variable

Mott Scattering

plots: displacement cross section PE, PDMS, MoS2, hBN

# transition:
# point 2: electron scattering (excitation and ionization)
Moller Scattering
plots: scatter: PE, PDMS, MoS2, hBN
PE as an example:
* band gap of ~6 eV
* probabilities of most likely transitions decrease with increasing t-energy
* direct transitions are more likely than indirect transitions
* The probabilities of direct transitions are insensitive to e-energy
* PDMS transitions are more likely
* hBN and MoS2

# transition: a more concrete example
# point 3: electronic excitations dramatically accelerate sputtering
excitations reduce binding energy
degree of bond softening depends on number of excitations
probabililty curves

Compare ground and excited DXS
